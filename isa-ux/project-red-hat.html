                    <p>We developed Skills Assessment, a learning path and recommendation tool that increased training
                        and certification sales by 15%

                    <p>My role was to lead the design of the user experience and interface. I ran cross-functional
                        workshops with team members,
                        conducted user interviews to ensure the user's voice was central to our design decisions and

                    <p>The process involved close collaboration between four key Red Hat teams: Sales, Marketing,
                        Curriculum, and the
                        RHLS team (Red Hat Learning Subscriptions), which develops and maintains the learning platforms
                        of which I was a member. I worked closely with stakeholders to gather business requirements and
                        understand user needs and pain points. I
                        also teamed up with a group of engineers (around 12 developers) to address technical constraints
                        and create a design
                        that was both practical and visually appealing.</p>

                        with user
                        needs. I conducted workshops with key stakeholders from Marketing, Sales and Engineering to
                        gather insights into
                        business

                        couple of usability concers like complex iteraction while filtering user's interests for the
                        assessment . Iteratively I
                        refined the design based on user feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was very intrigued to see that the pain points and features previously definend were solved in
                        the
                        prototype. It was interesting to see how the collaboration between the engineering and design
                        tem lead to
                        an app that not only meets technical standards but also delivers an optimised user experience.
