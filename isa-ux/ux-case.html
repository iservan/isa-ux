            <p>Skills Assessment 2.0 [SA 2.0] serves as a key sales tool, allowing Red Hat clients to evaluate their
              team's technical proficiency in enterprise products. It identifies skill gaps, providing an
              opportunity to upsell customized training courses and certification packages, ensuring technical
              adoption.</em></p>
            <!-- The new app generates performance reports upon completion of assessments, showcasing the company's skill gaps and
            encouraging managers to invest in Red Hat Learning Platforms subscriptions, being a great sales proposition. -->
            <p>The implementation of SA 2.0 involved close collaboration among four significant internal teams: Sales,
              Marketing, Curriculum and RHLS team <small>(Red Hat Learning Subscriptions)</small> which provides the
              technical capacities for developing and maintaining
              the learning platforms, of which I was a member. I collaborated extensively with all the stakeholders to
              gather business requirements and understand
              the user needs and pain points. I also worked closely with the engineer team to understand the high
              technical
              constraints and create a design that was both functional and visually appealing.

              The entire architecture, codebase, user experience and visual design were built from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>I established the UX research strategy, employing diverse methods such as: stakeholder workshops,
              user surveys, in-dept thinking-aloud video sessions and usability testing with focus groups; to gather insights into business goals, user needs and technical requirements. These methods facilitated collaboration
              and alignment among teams, helped us empathize with users needs and ensured that the final product was intuitive and user-friendly.

            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I consistently tracked and analyzed key metrics, (quantitative insights)
              using tools like Pendo, to promote data driven decision-making and understand user behavior, which ultimately boost user engagement, conversion and retentaion while driving business success.

                  Utilizing insights gathered from previous phase, I created detailed user personas representing

                  goals and pain points, guiding our design decisions.
                  This led me to conceptualize three different user journeys tailored to meet the specific needs of each
                  persona type.
                </p>
